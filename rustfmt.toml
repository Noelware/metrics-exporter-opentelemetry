# The `rustfmt.toml` configuration file does use Nightly features, which
# is OK since we are pointed to a Nightly release (via `rust-toolchain.toml`),
#
# Consumers who are only building the project don't need a Nightly toolchain
# required unless distributors use Clippy / rustfmt to check if a project's
# structure is ok like `nixpkgs`.
